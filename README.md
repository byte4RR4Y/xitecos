Linux distribution

"I have created a Linux distribution based on Debian Testing and MX Linux, and, what can I say, it is fast, very fast, and very user-friendly. It is a live system with an installer, and I hope that others will test it.

Advantages of Debian Testing:

    Rolling Release: Debian Testing is a rolling release distribution, providing users with access to the latest software updates and features without the need for a complete system upgrade.
    Up-to-date Software: Users can benefit from relatively recent versions of software packages, striking a balance between stability and cutting-edge features.
    Community Support: Debian has a large and active community, ensuring excellent support and a wealth of resources for users.

Advantages of MX Linux:

    Lightweight and Efficient: MX Linux is known for its efficiency and low system resource requirements, making it suitable for older hardware or systems with limited resources.
    Customization: MX Linux provides a user-friendly interface with a range of customization options, allowing users to tailor the desktop environment to their preferences.
    MX Tools: MX Linux includes a set of tools (MX Tools) that simplify various tasks, enhancing the overall user experience.
